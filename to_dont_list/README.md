# to_dont_list

A new Flutter project.

Grocery List App

Features
1. Adding grocery Items with their prices: Press the "+" button to add an item.
2. Deleting items: clicking on item to remove a grocery.
3. Calculates total price: Press the "Total" button to see the sum of all prices.

How it works
a. The items are stored as a List<Grocery> 
b. Each grocery object has a price and name
c. Flutter's setState updates the display when ever it's changed/edited



Code Structure 
I. Grocery Class
II. TodoList Widget
III. ToDoListGrocery Widget
VI. TodoDiaog widget

Future Improvements
 * We can use the Circle Avatar to include amount of item Which can be added to the total cost. This will help the user from entering the groceries again and again
